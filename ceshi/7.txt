 Polymer processing is an important step towards the shaping of an application. 
The challenge for the resin manufacturer is to define the optimal molecular structure 
meeting both processing criteria and the final application requirements. For polyolefin p
lastics, the resin design has been defined mainly by the limits of the available catalyst 
technology and the flexibility of the 
manufacturing units in place. The advent of the metallocene catalyst
