Research was conducted to determine the effects of slip additive
 level, antiblock additive level, and sealant layer thickness on the 
coefficient of friction, heat seal, hot tack, and optical properties of
 a coextruded blown film containing a polyolefin plastomer as the 
sealant layer. Mathematical modeling
 of the data was completed to determine the quantitative response
