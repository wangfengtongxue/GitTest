A model is proposed to describe the solidification and crystallization 
phenomena in rotational molding. To capture the morphology 
development with crystallization behavior, a two-dimensional theoretical 
simulation was carried out, consisting of a phase-field model emphasizing the 
metastability of polymer crystallization and a heat-transfer model describing
