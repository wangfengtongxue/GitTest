the molding cycle. The model parameters were 
experimentally evaluated with differential scanning
calorimetry and isothermal crystallization tests.
 Molding trials were also conducted with benchscale
 rotational molding equipment, and the cross
 sections of the molded products were examined 
under polarized light optical microscopy. 
The model predictions capture the formation 
of transcrystalline structures near the mold 
surface, which is more apparent under moderate
 cooling conditions. Our results show that the 
model predictions are in general agreement with
 the experimental results obtained in our laboratory
 as well as those presented in the literature. Because
 morphological features are important contributing 
factors to product performance, the model will be useful for
 the formulation of new materials and process 
optimization. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
