transitions. The manipulative variables are parameterized by piece-wise 
constant interpolation and a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used
 for finding the optimal parameters. The response is computed over a time
 horizon and the optimization is carried out for each sampling interval. 
The model is updated on-line to comply with measured quantities. 6
