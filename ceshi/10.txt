is placed on acquisition of reliable parameters which must be estimated from
 available analytical measurements of the product. A hybrid approach is proposed
 for parameter subset selection and estimation. Excellent agreement is obtained 
with experimental results for different product grades. 
The monomer feeding rate, which is a key controlling factor of bead properties,
