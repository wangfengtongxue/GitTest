technology had changed this outlook dramatically, offering true 
control over molecular weight (M), molecular weight distribution 
(MWD), and branching type, concentration and distribution. This paper 
explored the effects of the molecular weight and MWD variables on 
rheology using the the capability to produce narrow MWD 
ethylene/octene-1 copolymers provided by the DOW INSITE Technology.
