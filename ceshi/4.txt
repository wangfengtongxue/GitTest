temperatures covering the melt-temperature range of the polymers. The characteristic ratio was used to
 assess the quality of the conformers and the RMMC method. Values of 9.68 for PE and 9.27 for iPP were 
obtained. The single-chain structure factors calculated by the RMMC method were used to calculate the 
total structure factor for each melt. 
These were validated against published X-ray diffraction results.
