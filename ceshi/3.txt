data. Values were obtained for PE and iPP individually and for common 
universal parameters that could potentially be used for all polyolefins. 
The rotational isomeric state-metropolis Monte Carlo (RMMC) technique
 was used to generate sets of conformers at specified temperatures covering the 
melt-temperature range of the polymers. The characteristic ratio was
