 A mathematical model is developed and validated for a seeded 
suspension polymerization process that manufactures polystyrene 
beads starting from pretreated polyolefin seeds. For the manufacture
 of this specialty product, we focus on prediction of the dynamics of
 particle growth, polymerization
 rate and particle average molecular weight. Particular emphasis
