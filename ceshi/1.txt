 A general approach, based on the polymer reference interaction site model (PRIS
M) integral equation theory, suitable for characterizing arbitrarily complex poly-ol
efin melts is described. We tested the method by calculating the melt structures o
f linear polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the spinodal deco
mposition temperatures for PE/iPP blends. The computational expense of the PRIS
M calculation was reduced with a single-site united atom model in which the poly
olefin CH, CH2, and CH3 groups were approximated as chemically equivalent sites
 with spherical
ysymmetric energetic interactions. The site-site
